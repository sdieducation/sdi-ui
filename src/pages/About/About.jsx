						Since 2000, Iâ€™ve been working as a certified Coaching Professional who specializes in helping people cope with their issues. I coach my clients in a way that utilizes both their heads and their hearts. I first learned about coaching when I hit a roadblock in my own life and was struggling to move past it. The techniques I developed were so successful that friends and family began asking me for help with their own challenges. This motivated me to turn my newfound passion into a full-time career. If you have any questions about my methods, or would like to schedule a consultation, please get in touch today.
